    <p><strong>Serial Killers:</strong> </p>A serial killer (also called a serial murderer) 
    is typically a person who murders three or more persons,[1] with the murders
     taking place over more than a month and including a 
     significant period of time between them.
     [1][2] While most authorities set a threshold of three murders,
     [1] others extend it to four or lessen it to two.[3]

    Psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing,
     and many serial murders involve sexual contact with the victim.[4] 
     The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
     states that the motives of serial killers can include anger,
      thrill-seeking, financial gain, and attention seeking, 
      and killings may be executed as such.[5] 
      The victims may have something in common; for example, demographic profile,
       appearance, gender or race.
      [6] Often the FBI will focus on a particular pattern serial killers follow.
      [7] Based on this pattern, 
      this will give key clues into finding the killer along with their motives.[8]
    
    Although a serial killer is a distinct classification that differs from that of a mass murderer, 
    spree killer, or contract killer, there exist conceptual overlaps between them. Some debate exists
     on the specific criteria for each category, especially with regard to the distinction between spree
      killers and serial killers.[9]</p>

      <p>Etymology and definition</p>
      The English term and concept of serial killer are commonly attributed to former FBI Special agent Robert Ressler, 
      who used the term serial homicide in 1974 in a lecture at Police Staff Academy in Bramshill, Hampshire, England, 
      United Kingdom.[10] Author Ann Rule postulates in her 2004 book Kiss Me, Kill Me, that the English-language credit for 
      coining the term goes to LAPD detective Pierce Brooks, who created the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) system in 1985.[11]

The German term and concept were coined by criminologist Ernst Gennat, who described Peter Kürten as a Serienmörder
 ('serial-murderer') in his article "Die Düsseldorfer Sexualverbrechen" (1930).[12] In his book, Serial Killers:
  The Method and Madness of Monsters (2004), criminal justice historian Peter Vronsky notes that while Ressler might 
  have coined the English term "serial homicide" within the law in 1974, the terms serial murder and serial murderer
   appear in John Brophy's book The Meaning of Murder (1966).[13] The Washington, D.C., newspaper Evening Star,
    in a 1967 review of the book:[14]

There is the mass murderer, or what he [Brophy] calls the "serial" killer, who may be actuated by greed,
 such as insurance, or retention or growth of power, like the Medicis of Renaissance Italy, or Landru, 
 the "bluebeard" of the World War I period, who murdered numerous wives after taking their money. </p>

<p><strong>Serial Killers:</strong></p> The Method and Madness of Monsters (2004) is a non-fiction true crime history by Peter Vronsky, 
    a criminal justice historian. It surveys the history of serial homicide, its culture, psychopathology,
     and investigation from the Roman Empire to the early 2000s.[1] The book describes the rise of serial murder 
     from its first early recorded instances in ancient Rome to medieval and Renaissance Europe, and Victorian Britain, 
     and its rise and escalation in the United States and elsewhere in the world, in the postmodern era. The book also surveys 
     a range of theoretical approaches to serial killers interspersed with dozens of detailed case studies of both notorious and 
     lesser known serial murderers, illustrating the theory in practice. Considered by some a definitive history of serial homicide,[2]
     this was the book serial killer Dennis Rader, the BTK Killer, was reading when he was arrested in 2005.[3]</p>

     <p><strong>Serial Killers is divided into three parts:</strong></p>
     <ul>

      <li> history of serial murder from  its ancient roots to approximately the mid-1960s,
        when Vronsky argues it became popular 
         in its postmodernity. Vronsky proposes that modern culture, media, and society degrade certain 
         classes of people in the perception of homicidal psychopaths, who serially target and murder them 
         in an attempt to satisfy increasingly addictive sexual, hedonistic fantasies. 
         Vronsky points to the high proportion of street prostitutes, runaway youths, cruising homosexuals, 
         or people who are homeless, impoverished, disabled, or elderly among serial killer victims; i.e., 
         victims who are often characterized as society's "throwaways". Vronsky argues that only the presence
          of children and young college girls among preferred victims of serial killers raise concerns about
           these predators in society at large. He reviews several sources of statistical data on serial homicide,
            its patterns, and trends, particularly in the United States, and explores the myth of the recent "serial killer epidemic".[4]</li>

       <li> focuses on the psychopathology of serial killers, their evolution from child to adult, 
        and the various emerging and evolving categories and profiles of serial offenders. 
        Vronsky points out that law enforcement, psychologists, psychiatrists, and criminologists disagree 
        among themselves as to how to categorize the broad range of offender types, and explores some of the 
        different approaches, all illustrated with case study examples.[5</li>
        
       <li> focuses on the investigation of serial homicide, particularly on the various profiling systems from the FBI's
         "crime scene analysis" profiling, to British law enforcement's "psychological profiling", and Canadian police development of
          "geographic profiling". Vronsky explores the pros and cons of the various systems with case study examples of how profiling
           has both succeeded and failed in homicide investigations.[6] </li>
        
       <p> Serial Killers concludes with a chapter based on FBI studies and statements by serial killers and a 
        few survivors of serial killer attacks as how to best survive an encounter with a serial killer.</p>
