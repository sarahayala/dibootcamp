        <p class="yaffa" id="yellow">The avocado, also referred to as the alligator pear, can be divided into three main categories, West Indian,
            Guatemalan, and Mexican. In the United States, the Guatemalan is the most popular. Avocados are native to
            Central
            and South America, and have been cultivated in these regions since 8,000 B.C.E. The avocado was introduced
            to
            Jamaica
            and tropical Asian regions in the mid-1800s. Cultivation in the United States began in the early twentieth
            century,
            and is concentrated in Florida and California.</p>
        <p class="yaffa" id="green">Avocados can be enjoyed any time of the day. For a breakfast, a favorite is to mash avocados on top of
            whole-wheat toast.
            Use mashed avocado instead of mayonnaise on sandwiches, or enjoy guacamole for lunch or dinner. Try
            combining
            sliced avocado,
            fennel, oranges, and fresh mint for a tasty salad. For information on other nutritious fruits,
            take a look at my “Encyclopedia of Healing Foods”.</p>
